			This is a cool trick. Rather than including only tease.twig, we can include the tease partial based on the post type. This lets us use a file like tease-cpt_name.twig that will be included because of the post.post_type value below. 

			So, for example, if you have a post type with the name of "lesson" (notice all lowercase because that's what it's called in the code), you can create a file called tease-lesson.twig. Similarly, if you had a CPT for "recipe", you can create a tease-recipe.twig.


			You'll notice we are also including tease.twig. This acts as a fallback if there is no tease-post_type.twig.

			Handy, right?
